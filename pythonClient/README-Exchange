Installation Instructions
	Set the EXCHANGE_CLIENT_HOME environment variable to $HOME/eXchange:
		bash --> export EXCHANGE_CLIENT_HOME=~/eXchange

	Untar into your home directory.  This will create the following:
		$HOME/.aws/credentials -- the client ID for Cognito access
		$HOME/eXchange
		$HOME/eXchange/lib -- place where the python clients reside
		$HOME/eXchange/eXchange-client.properties -- place for Exchange credentials

	Make sure you have python3 on your PATH.  I used /appl/tools/R-3.4.3/bin/python3
	Make sure you have boto3 installed
	Make sure you have set both HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY:
		
		export HTTP_PROXY=http://zsproxy.fanniemae.com:10479
		export HTTPS_PROXY=http://zsproxy.fanniemae.com:10479

	Edit $HOME/eXchange/eXchange-client.properties so it contains your Exchange user ID and password

Always invoke the client with "python3".  

BASE MODULES
	exchange_client.py
		code to get auth tokens plus a few ancillary functions.  
		If run directly from the command line, exchange_client.py 
		fetches and displays an auth token to stdout.

	exchange_paginated_api.py
		Code that knows how to walk paginated API responses to fetch the 
		entire payload and write it to a file.  You can see it in action by 
		looking at mh-loans-client.py, which fetches the entire portfolio
		of Manufacture Housing loans (as obtained from LPA).

	exchange_nonpaginated_api.py
		Code that handles simple non-paginated API calls.  For example, 
		nhs_client.py delegates much of its work to 
		exchange_nonpaginated_api.py.

CONCRETE CLIENTS

	loan-limits-client.py
		Given a two-character state abbreviation and a county name, 
		retrieves the loan limits in place for that county; for example, 
		try 
			python3 loan-limits-client.py MT 'Missoula County'

	mh-communities-count-client.py
		Creates a file named /tmp/mhc-counts.json containing a state-by-state
		count of manufactured housing communities (as reported by Reonomy).

	mh-communities-nationwide-aggregations-client.py
		Creates a file named /tmp/mhc-nationwide-communities-count.json that
		contains the total count of MHCs across the nation.

	mh-loans-client.py
		Uses the exchange_paginated_client to retrieve all MH loans and write 
		them to an output file (defaults to stdout, specify an output file
		name on the command line to have it write the output elsewhere).

	nhs-client.py
		Retrieves the most recent NHS results and writes them as JSON to 
		either stdout (default) or a specific file if a file name is passed
		in from the command line.
